# Lol Spectator Overlay

This is a tool that produces a custom League of Legends Champion Select Overlay that is inspired by the one used in the LEC and LCS between 2015-2017.

## Usage

Just download the latest release for your platform and you are nearly ready to go. 
First run the `lol-esports-spectate-client.exe` and after that you just have to join a custom lobby AS A SPECTATOR and press the button `Start Overlay`. 
If there is some weird behavior you can restart the Overlay by using `Stop Overlay` and `Start Overlay`, which should fix most errors.
Furthermore you can customize the colors of the overlay with the different color pickers.
